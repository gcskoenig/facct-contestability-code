Could not find an anchor satisfying the 0.9 precision constraint. Now returning the best non-eligible result. The desired precision threshold might not be achieved due to the quantile-based discretisation of the numerical features. The resolution of the bins may be too large to find an anchor of required precision. Consider increasing the number of bins in `disc_perc`, but note that for some numerical distribution (e.g. skewed distribution) it may not help.

The desired precision threshold might not be achieved due to the quantile-based discretisation of the numerical features. The resolution of the bins may be too large to find an anchor of required precision. Consider increasing the number of bins in `disc_perc`, but note that for some numerical distribution (e.g. skewed distribution) it may not help.

Could not find an anchor satisfying the 0.9 precision constraint. Now returning the best non-eligible result. The desired precision threshold might not be achieved due to the quantile-based discretisation of the numerical features. The resolution of the bins may be too large to find an anchor of required precision. Consider increasing the number of bins in `disc_perc`, but note that for some numerical distribution (e.g. skewed distribution) it may not help.

Could not find an anchor satisfying the 0.9 precision constraint. Now returning the best non-eligible result. The desired precision threshold might not be achieved due to the quantile-based discretisation of the numerical features. The resolution of the bins may be too large to find an anchor of required precision. Consider increasing the number of bins in `disc_perc`, but note that for some numerical distribution (e.g. skewed distribution) it may not help.
